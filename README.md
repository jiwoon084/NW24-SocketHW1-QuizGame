# NW24-SocketHW1-QuizGame
A client-server-based quiz game was implemented using Java socket programming. 
The server sends questions to the client, and the client connects to the server to receive quiz questions, submit answers, and receive feedback and the final score from the server. 
This project aims to understand the functionality of network-based applications and develop skills in protocol design and handling.
